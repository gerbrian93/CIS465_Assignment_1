<h3>Part 2</h3>

   <p>Here I turned the program into a method and inputted the second list I created that has different dimensions.
      As we can see, the output still performs the encoding and outputs a 2d list that is the same size as the input. 
      I did use another method to apply a padding around the lists, which acts as a padding we would use to add to a 
      photo with the cv library.
